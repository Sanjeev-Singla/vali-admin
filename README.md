# admin-panel

Here this is the Vali Admin Panel.

1. You just need to download the source code.
2. This is also including SQL(admin-panel->panel.sql) file which we can import to the MYSQL database.
3. Then need to change the settings in database.php (admin-panel->application->config->database.php) to connect with DATABASE.
4. Last thing is we just need to change the base_url in config.php (admin-panel->application->config->config.php).
